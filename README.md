# House Price Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I performed an analysis of property prices in the city of Bangalore using the `house_price.csv` dataset. The main objective was to examine the price per square feet and detect outliers using various methods such as mean function, percentile method, interquartile range method, normal distribution, and Z-score method. Additionally, I visualized the data using box plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots.

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded the dataset and examined if there are any null values.
- Detected outliers in the price per square feet column using box plots and histograms.
- Removed outliers using mean function, percentile method, interquartile range method, normal distribution, and Z-score method.
- Plotted box plots for all numerical columns to visualize outliers.
- Checked the normality of the price per square feet column using a histogram.
- Calculated the correlation between numerical columns and plotted a heatmap.
- Created scatter plots between variables to check their correlation.

# Visualizations
- Box plot of Price per Sqft
- Histogram of Price per Sqft
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot of Numerical Columns

## Conclusion
***Overall, this analysis provides insights into the distribution of property prices in Bangalore and highlights the effectiveness of various outlier detection methods. The visualizations help in understanding the relationships between different numerical variables and identifying any potential patterns or trends.***



# Hypothesis Testing

# Hypothesis Testing

## Introduction
In this project, we perform hypothesis tests to analyze claims made in two different scenarios. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. 

## Tasks
### Task 1: Child Psychologist's Claim
- **Claim:** A child psychologist states that the average time working mothers spend talking to their children is at least 11 minutes per day.
- **Sample:** A random sample of 1000 working mothers is taken, and their average time spent talking to children is found to be 11.5 minutes per day.
- **Population Standard Deviation:** Prior research suggests the population standard deviation is 2.3 minutes.
- **Hypothesis Test:** We conduct a hypothesis test with a level of significance (alpha) of 0.05 to determine if there is enough evidence to support the psychologist's claim.

### Task 2: Coffee Shop's Claim
- **Claim:** A coffee shop claims that their average wait time for customers is less than 5 minutes.
- **Sample:** A sample of 40 customers is taken, and their wait times are recorded. The sample mean wait time is found to be 4.6 minutes with a standard deviation of 0.8 minutes.
- **Hypothesis Test:** We perform a hypothesis test at a significance level of 0.05 to determine whether there is enough evidence to support the coffee shop's claim.

## Conclusion
Hypothesis testing allows us to evaluate claims or hypotheses about population parameters using sample data. By setting up null and alternative hypotheses and conducting appropriate tests, we can make informed decisions about the validity of these claims. The results of these tests provide valuable insights for decision-making in various fields.
