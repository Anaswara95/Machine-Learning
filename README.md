# House Price Analysis

## Introduction
In this project, I performed an analysis of property prices in the city of Bangalore using the `house_price.csv` dataset. The main objective was to examine the price per square feet and detect outliers using various methods such as mean function, percentile method, interquartile range method, normal distribution, and Z-score method. Additionally, I visualized the data using box plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots.

## Tasks Completed
- Loaded the dataset and examined if there are any null values.
- Detected outliers in the price per square feet column using box plots and histograms.
- Removed outliers using mean function, percentile method, interquartile range method, normal distribution, and Z-score method.
- Plotted box plots for all numerical columns to visualize outliers.
- Checked the normality of the price per square feet column using a histogram.
- Calculated the correlation between numerical columns and plotted a heatmap.
- Created scatter plots between variables to check their correlation.

# Visualizations
- Box plot of Price per Sqft
- Histogram of Price per Sqft
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplot of Numerical Columns

# Conclusion
***Overall, this analysis provides insights into the distribution of property prices in Bangalore and highlights the effectiveness of various outlier detection methods. The visualizations help in understanding the relationships between different numerical variables and identifying any potential patterns or trends.***
